Of course. Here are diagrams for each of the RabbitMQ messaging patterns, drawn with ASCII art.

### 1. Simple Queue ("Hello, World")

The producer sends a message directly to a named queue. A single consumer listens to that specific queue.

```
[P] -----> (my_queue) -----> [C]

  P = Producer
  C = Consumer
  () = Queue
```

---

### 2. Work Queues (Task Distribution)

One producer sends "tasks" (messages) to a single queue. Multiple consumers subscribe to that same queue, and RabbitMQ distributes the incoming messages among them. This is used for load balancing.

```
          /-----> [C1] (gets message 1, 3, 5...)
         /
[P] ---> (task_queue)
         \
          \-----> [C2] (gets message 2, 4, 6...)

  C1, C2 = Independent Consumer processes
```

---

### 3. Publish/Subscribe (Fanout Exchange)

The producer sends a message to an **exchange**, not a queue. The `fanout` exchange then broadcasts a copy of that message to *every* queue that is bound to it.

```
          /-----> (Queue A) -----> [Consumer A]
         /
[P] ---> <X> --(binding)--> (Queue B) -----> [Consumer B]
         \
          \-----> (Queue C) -----> [Consumer C]

  <X> = Fanout Exchange
```

---

### 4. Routing (Direct Exchange)

The producer sends a message to a `direct` exchange with a specific **routing key** (e.g., `error`). The exchange only forwards the message to queues whose **binding key** exactly matches the message's routing key.

*Scenario: A message with `routing_key = "error"` is sent.*

```
                                 Binding Key: "error"
                                /---------------------> (Error Queue) -----> [Error Consumer]
                               /
[P] --(msg, key="error")--> <X Direct>
                               \
                                \---------------------> (Info Queue)  -----> [Info Consumer]
                                 Binding Key: "info"

Result: Only the 'Error Consumer' gets the message.
```

### 5. Topics (Topic Exchange)

This is the most flexible pattern. The producer sends a message with a topic-style routing key (e.g., `usa.weather.report`). The `topic` exchange forwards the message to queues whose binding key matches the routing key based on wildcards.

*   `*` (star) matches exactly one word.
*   `#` (hash) matches zero or more words.

*Scenario: A message with `routing_key = "kern.critical.log"` is sent.*

```
                                     Binding: "kern.*.log"
                                    /----------------------> (Kernel Logs Queue) ---> [Kernel Consumer]
                                   /
[P] --(msg, key="kern.critical.log")--> <X Topic> --(binding)--> (Critical Logs Queue) -> [Critical Consumer]
                                   \
                                    \----------------------> (All Logs Queue) ------> [Archive Consumer]
                                     Binding: "#"

Result:
- 'Kernel Consumer' gets the message (matches "kern.*.log").
- 'Critical Consumer' does NOT get it (binding "critical.*" does not match).
- 'Archive Consumer' gets the message (matches "#").
